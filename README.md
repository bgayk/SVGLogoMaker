  ## Tests 

  Jest was used to test that the expected SVG shapes are rendered with the expected sizes. Test files are located in the test folder and can be run via the ‘npm test’ command. Expectation is that a logo.svg file will be generated in the working folder where index.js resides containing the user’s selections.
